# Binary compatibility validator

The tool allows to dump binary API of a Kotlin library that is public in sense of Kotlin visibilities and ensures that the public binary API wasn't changed in a way that make this change binary incompatible.

## Setup

Binary compatibility validator is a Gradle plugin that is added to the `build.gradle` in the following way:

```
ext.validator_version = "0.2.3"

buildscript {
    dependencies {
        classpath "org.jetbrains.kotlinx:binary-compatibility-validator:$validator_version"
    }
}
                    
apply plugin: 'binary-compatibility-validator'
```

It is enough to apply the plugin only to the root configuration file; all sub-projects will be configured automatically.

### Tasks

The plugin provides two tasks:

  * `apiDump` — builds the project and dumps its public API in project `api` subfolder. 
  API is dumped in a human-readable format. If API dump already exists, it will be overwritten.
  * `apiCheck` — builds the project and checks that project's public API is the same as golden value
  in project `api` subfolder. This task is automatically inserted into `check` pipeline, so both `build` and `check`
  tasks will start checking public API upon their execution.

### Optional parameters

Binary compatibility validator can be additionally configured with the following DSL:

```kotlin
apiValidation {
    /**
     * Packages that are excluded from public API dumps even if they
     * contain public API. 
     */
    ignoredPackages += ["kotlinx.coroutines.internal"]

    /**
     * Sub-projects that are excluded from API validation 
     */
    ignoredProjects += ["benchmarks", "examples"]
    
    /**
     * Set of annotations that exclude API from being public.
     * Typically, it is all kinds of `@InternalApi` annotations that mark 
     * effectively private API that cannot be actually private for technical reasons.
     */
    nonPublicMarkers += ["my.package.MyInternalApiAnnotation"]

    /**
     * Flag to programmatically disable compatibility validator
     */
    validationDisabled = true
}
```


### Workflow

When starting to validate your library public API, we recommend the following workflow:

- Preparation phase (one-time action):
  * As the first step, apply the plugin, configure it and execute `apiDump`.
  * Validate your public API manually.
  * Commit `.api` files to your VCS.
  * At this moment, default `check` task will validate public API along with test run and will fail 
    the build if API differs.
 
- Regular workflow
  * When doing code changes that do not imply any changes in public API, no additional 
    actions should be performed. `check` task on your CI will validate everything.
  * When doing code changes that imply changes in public API, whether it is a new API or
    adjustments in existing one, `check` task will start to fail. `apiDump` should be executed manually,
    the resulting diff in `.api` file should be verified: only signatures you expected to change should be changed.
  * Commit the resulting `.api` diff along with code changes. 

# What constitutes the public API

### Classes

A class is considered to be effectively public if all of the following conditions are met:

 - it has public or protected JVM access (`ACC_PUBLIC` or `ACC_PROTECTED`)
 - it has one of the following visibilities in Kotlin:
    - no visibility (means no Kotlin declaration corresponds to this compiled class)
    - *public*
    - *protected*
    - *internal*, only in case if the class is annotated with `PublishedApi`
 - it isn't a local class
 - it isn't a synthetic class with mappings for `when` tableswitches (`$WhenMappings`)
 - it contains at least one effectively public member, in case if the class corresponds
   to a kotlin *file* with top-level members or a *multifile facade*
 - in case if the class is a member in another class, it is contained in the *effectively public* class
 - in case if the class is a protected member in another class, it is contained in the *non-final* class

### Members

A member of the class (i.e. a field or a method) is considered to be effectively public
if all of the following conditions are met:

 - it has public or protected JVM access (`ACC_PUBLIC` or `ACC_PROTECTED`)
 - it has one of the following visibilities in Kotlin:
    - no visibility (means no Kotlin declaration corresponds to this class member)
    - *public*
    - *protected*
    - *internal*, only in case if the class is annotated with `PublishedApi`

    > Note that Kotlin visibility of a field exposed by `lateinit` property is the visibility of its setter.
 - in case if the member is protected, it is contained in *non-final* class
 - it isn't a synthetic access method for a private field

## What makes an incompatible change to the public binary API

### Class changes

For a class a binary incompatible change is:

 - changing the full class name (including package and containing classes)
 - changing the superclass, so that the class no longer has the previous superclass in
   the inheritance chain
 - changing the set of implemented interfaces so that the class
   no longer implements interfaces it had implemented before
 - changing one of the following access flags:
    - `ACC_PUBLIC`, `ACC_PROTECTED`, `ACC_PRIVATE` — lessening the class visibility
    - `ACC_FINAL` — making non-final class final
    - `ACC_ABSTRACT` — making non-abstract class abstract
    - `ACC_INTERFACE` — changing class to interface and vice versa
    - `ACC_ANNOTATION` — changing annotation to interface and vice versa

### Class member changes

For a class member a binary incompatible change is:

 - changing its name
 - changing its descriptor (erased return type and parameter types for methods);
   this includes changing field to method and vice versa
 - changing one of the following access flags:
    - `ACC_PUBLIC`, `ACC_PROTECTED`, `ACC_PRIVATE` — lessening the member visibility
    - `ACC_FINAL` — making non-final field or method final
    - `ACC_ABSTRACT` — making non-abstract method abstract
    - `ACC_STATIC` — changing instance member to static and vice versa
